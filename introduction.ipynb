    "- This tool is, by design, very agnostic. It collects all the data it can find. The data is not cleaned, it comes from many sources and some may not be using the same conventions. The philosphy is that with enough data these variations become invisible. This is a bad philosphy. The point of SEDBuilder is to make SED data accesesible, visible and usable, but be very wary that the flood of data may be hiding significant trends or variations. I advise that you plot everything you work with, no better tool than the human eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a follow up, you won't have to look at a large number of spectra (i.e. more than 2) to start spotting some data points that seem like clear outliers. They probably are, either just rogue data points, multiple objects in view (particularly a problem with IRAS) or even perfectly physical and completely unhelpful variability. If you want to fit anything you'll likely need to decide how to handle these, maybe on a case by case basis, and use a lot of care.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If one author uses a data point from another publication, and publishes it in a machine readable form, Vizier will find both and both data points will appear here. They may be identical or slightly shifted (e.g. if they've been dereddened - a whole issue in itself). Watch out for doubling up (a tool that ~deals with this is on its way, see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you're getting a ton of warnings (especially from astroquery.IRSA) you can uncomment a few lines at the top of spectra.py. This will suppress all warnings, probably a fine thing to do but I'm leaving it on while developing the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you want there is an optional parameter windowSize in getSED which limits how large a region around the star to return SED points from. The default value is windowSize=2 (in milli-arcseconds) and is the radius within which SED points are returned. The center point is the star position according to Simbad (not always perfect, hence I suggest not making windowSize < ~1). Equally, some measurements can be quite far from the star, but still have it as the main object in the field. However, if you think you're getting contamination from a nearby source you can try decreasing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There's a (blank) extra field, called 'ExtraField', in the data in which you can record any other detail you wish. If you use this a lot you might want to hardcode that parameter, or ask me to. You can write to it easily using 'rewriteExtraField(twoMassID,saveDir,entry)' where entry is whatever you want to put in there (Note that in saving it, I think this will be converted to a string. You can put whatever you want in there, including arrays, dictionaries or lists, if you can convert it to a string and back.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you're just enjoying the quick access to Simbad via getInfo() you may want to use the getCoords() function. It's very simple, just takes a (Simbad recognised) name and returns the coordiantes of that object. Not used anywhere here but thought I'd leave it in.\n",
